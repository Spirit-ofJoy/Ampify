1
00:00:05,409 --> 00:00:08,308
I have paid my dues

2
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:11,817
Time after time

3
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:15,216
I have done my sentence

4
00:00:16,508 --> 00:00:19,707
But committed no crime

5
00:00:20,705 --> 00:00:23,104
And bad mistakes

6
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:26,907
I have made a few

7
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:31,818
I have had my share of sand
kicked in my face

8
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,405
But I have come through

9
00:00:34,413 --> 00:00:38,712
(And I need just go on and
on‚ and on‚ and on)

10
00:00:38,802 --> 00:00:44,301
We are the champions‚ my friends

11
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:52,116
And we′ll keep on fighting
′til the end

12
00:00:53,914 --> 00:00:57,613
We are the champions

13
00:00:57,715 --> 00:01:01,414
We are the champions

14
00:01:01,504 --> 00:01:04,903
No time for losers

15
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:17,310
′Cause we are the champions
of the world

16
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,813
I have taken my bows

17
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:27,608
And my curtain calls

18
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:33,317
You brought me fame and fortune‚ and
everything that goes with it

19
00:01:33,413 --> 00:01:35,012
I thank you all

20
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,109
But It is been no bed of roses

21
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:43,510
No pleasure cruise

22
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:47,605
I consider it a challenge before
the whole human race

23
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:50,118
And I ain′t gona lose

24
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:54,303
(And I need just go on and
on‚ and on‚ and on)

25
00:01:54,415 --> 00:02:00,314
We are the champions‚ my friends

26
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:08,003
And we′ll keep on fighting
′til the end

27
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:13,208
We are the champions

28
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:17,007
We are the champions

29
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:20,610
No time for losers

30
00:02:20,702 --> 00:02:26,101
′Cause we are the champions
of the world

31
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:32,318
We are the champions‚ my friends

32
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:40,105
And we′ll keep on fighting
′til the end

33
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:44,912
We are the champions

34
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:48,711
We are the champions

35
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:52,202
No time for losers

36
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:57,511
′Cause we are the champions

37
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:07,510
