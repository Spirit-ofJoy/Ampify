00:00:18,012 --> 00:00:26,011
Loving can hurt‚ loving
can hurt sometimes

2
00:00:26,813 --> 00:00:34,812
But It is the only thing that I know

3
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:43,799
When it gets hard‚ you know
it can get hard sometimes

4
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:52,718
It is the only thing that
makes us feel alive

5
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,609
We keep this love in a photograph

6
00:00:58,813 --> 00:01:02,712
We made these memories for ourselves

7
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,999
Where our eyes are never closing

8
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:07,102
Hearts are never broken

9
00:01:07,314 --> 00:01:11,313
And time′s forever frozen still

10
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:14,408
So you can keep me

11
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:18,811
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans

12
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:22,900
Holding me closer ′til our eyes met

13
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:31,109
You won′t ever be alone‚ wait
for me to come home

14
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:41,606
Loving can heal‚ loving
can mend your soul

15
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:50,411
And It is the only thing
that I know‚ know

16
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:54,410
I swear it will get easier

17
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:59,303
Remember that with every piece of you

18
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:07,498
Hm‚ and It is the only thing we
take with us when we die

19
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:14,509
Hm‚ we keep this love
in this photograph

20
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:18,516
We made these memories for ourselves

21
00:02:18,716 --> 00:02:20,415
Where our eyes are never closing

22
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:22,608
Hearts were never broken

23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,799
And time′s forever frozen still

24
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:29,816
So you can keep me

25
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:34,113
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans

26
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:38,500
Holding me closer ′til our eyes met

27
00:02:38,702 --> 00:02:44,901
You won′t ever be alone

28
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:47,406
And if you hurt me

29
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,809
That′s okay baby‚ only words bleed

30
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:56,302
Inside these pages you just hold me

31
00:02:56,518 --> 00:03:01,217
And I won′t ever let you go

32
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:05,610
Wait for me to come home

33
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:09,811
Wait for me to come home

34
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:14,314
Wait for me to come home

35
00:03:14,516 --> 00:03:20,515
Wait for me to come home

36
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:22,802
You can fit me

37
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:27,711
Inside the necklace you got
when you were sixteen

38
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:31,816
Next to your heartbeat
where I should be

39
00:03:32,018 --> 00:03:38,517
Keep it deep within your soul

40
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,808
And if you hurt me

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,099
Well‚ that′s okay baby‚
only words bleed

42
00:03:45,313 --> 00:03:49,612
Inside these pages you just hold me

43
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:56,117
And I won′t ever let you go

44
00:03:56,301 --> 00:04:03,200
When I am away‚ I will remember
how you kissed me

45
00:04:03,414 --> 00:04:07,413
Under the lamppost back
on Sixth street

46
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:12,210
Hearing you whisper through the phone

47
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:17,415
Wait for me to come home.
