1
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:41,800
We couldn′t turn around ′til
we were upside down

2
00:00:42,806 --> 00:00:50,305
I will be the bad guy now‚ but
know I ain′t too proud

3
00:00:50,803 --> 00:00:57,602
I couldn′t be there even when I tried

4
00:00:58,814 --> 00:01:04,513
You don′t believe it‚ we
do this every time

5
00:01:04,603 --> 00:01:08,702
Seasons change and our love went cold

6
00:01:08,816 --> 00:01:12,615
Feed the flame ′cause we can′t let go

7
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:16,610
Run away‚ but We are
running in circles

8
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:19,007
Run away‚ run away

9
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:22,814
I dare you to do something

10
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:28,607
I am waiting on you again‚ so
I don′t take the blame

11
00:01:28,717 --> 00:01:32,716
Run away‚ but We are
running in circles

12
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:36,501
Run away‚ run away‚ run away

13
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:42,314
Let go‚ I got a feeling that
It is time to let go

14
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,309
I said so‚ I knew that this was
doomed from the get go

15
00:01:51,315 --> 00:01:54,914
You thought that it was
special‚ special

16
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:59,001
But it was just the sex though‚
the sex though

17
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:02,610
And I still hear the echoes
(The echoes)

18
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:08,713
I got a feeling that It is time
to let it go‚ let it go

19
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:12,712
Seasons change and our love went cold

20
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:16,611
Feed the flame ′cause we can′t let go

21
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:20,600
Run away‚ but We are
running in circles

22
00:02:20,714 --> 00:02:23,113
Run away‚ run away

23
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:26,904
I dare you to do something

24
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:32,811
I am waiting on you again‚ so
I don′t take the blame

25
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:36,616
Run away‚ but We are
running in circles

26
00:02:36,712 --> 00:02:40,911
Run away‚ run away‚ run away

27
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:44,610
Maybe you don′t understand
what I am going through

28
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:48,605
It is only me‚ what you got to lose?

29
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:52,508
Make up your mind‚ tell me‚
what are you gona do?

30
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,709
It is only me‚ let it go

31
00:02:56,811 --> 00:03:00,710
Seasons change and our love went cold

32
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:04,605
Feed the flame ′cause we can′t let go

33
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,608
Run away‚ but We are
running in circles

34
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,007
Run away‚ run away

35
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,906
I dare you to do something

36
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:20,913
I am waiting on you again‚ so
I don′t take the blame

37
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:24,714
Run away‚ but We are
running in circles
