00:00:04,196 --> 00:00:07,165
Lately I have been thinking

2
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,856
I want you to be happier

3
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:11,933
I want you to be happier

4
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:14,790
When the morning come

5
00:00:14,804 --> 00:00:17,093
When we see what we′ve become

6
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:18,202
In the cold light of day

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,989
We are a flame in the wind not
the fire that we′ve begun

8
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,968
Every argument

9
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:26,125
Every word we can′t take back

10
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:27,910
Cause with all that has happened

11
00:00:27,978 --> 00:00:31,527
I think that we both know
the way that story ends

12
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:36,110
Then only for a minute

13
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:38,581
I want to change my mind

14
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:42,290
Cause this just don′t feel right to me

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,599
I wanna raise your spirit is

16
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:48,422
I want to see you smile

17
00:00:48,452 --> 00:00:51,771
Know that means I will have to leave

18
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:01,642
Know that means I will have to leave

19
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,939
Lately I have been thinking

20
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:10,332
I want you to be happier

21
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:12,197
When the evevning falls

22
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:13,960
And I am left there with my thougts

23
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:17,035
And the image of you being
with someone else

24
00:01:17,057 --> 00:01:19,856
Well It is eating me up inside

25
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,659
But we ran our course

26
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:23,948
We pretended We are okay

27
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:25,751
Now if we jump together

28
00:01:25,815 --> 00:01:30,024
At least we can swing far away
from the wreck we made

29
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,617
Then only for a minute

30
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:35,842
I want to change my mind

31
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:39,407
Cause this just don′t feel right to me

32
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:43,306

33
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:45,943
I want to see you smile

34
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:49,734
Know that means I will have to leave

35

I want you to be happier

38
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:10,644
So I will go

39
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:13,137

40
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:17,434
