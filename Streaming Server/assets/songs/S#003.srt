00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:30,004
I have been tryna call

2
00:00:30,704 --> 00:00:33,203
I have been on my own for long enough

3
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:38,098
Maybe you can show me
how to love‚ maybe

4
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:41,607
I am going through withdrawals

5
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,218
You don′t even have to do too much

6
00:00:44,302 --> 00:00:49,601
You can turn me on with
just a touch‚ baby

7
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:51,400
I look around and

8
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,917
Sin City′s cold and empty

9
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:56,508
No one′s around to judge me

10
00:00:56,614 --> 00:01:00,413
I can′t see clearly when You are gone

11
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:07,304
I said‚ ooh‚ I am blinded
by the lights

12
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:12,601
No‚ I can′t sleep until
I feel your touch

13
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,418
I said‚ ooh‚ I am drowning
in the night

14
00:01:18,504 --> 00:01:22,903
Oh‚ when I am like this‚ You
are the one I trust

15
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:25,700
Hey‚ hey‚ hey

16
00:01:34,704 --> 00:01:37,303
I am running out of time

17
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:40,668
′Cause I can see the sun
light up the sky

18
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:47,551
So I hit the road in overdrive‚
baby‚ oh

19
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:50,100
The city′s cold and empty

20
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,807
No one′s around to judge me

21
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:57,514
I can′t see clearly when You are gone

22
00:01:57,604 --> 00:02:03,303
I said‚ ooh‚ I am blinded
by the lights

23
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:08,704
No‚ I can′t sleep until
I feel your touch

24
00:02:08,802 --> 00:02:14,501
I said‚ ooh‚ I am drowning
in the night

25
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:19,504
Oh‚ when I am like this‚ You
are the one I trust

26
00:02:20,204 --> 00:02:22,803
I am just calling back to let you
know (Back to let you know)

27
00:02:22,913 --> 00:02:25,512
I could never say it on the phone
(Say it on the phone)

28
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:31,305
Will never let you go this time

29
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:37,100
I said‚ ooh‚ I am blinded
by the lights

30
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:41,517
No‚ I can′t sleep until
I feel your touch

31
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:44,312
Hey‚ hey‚ hey

32
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,699
I said‚ ooh‚ I am blinded
by the lights

33
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:16,204
No‚ I can′t sleep until
I feel your touch
