1
00:00:07,915 --> 00:00:10,114
I have been reading books of old

2
00:00:10,202 --> 00:00:12,501
The legends and the myths

3
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:14,714
Achilles and his gold

4
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:17,207
Hercules and his gifts

5
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:19,510
Spiderman′s control

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,309
And Batman with his fists

7
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:26,104
And clearly I don′t see
myself upon that list

8
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:28,813
But she said‚ where′d you wanna go?

9
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,002
How much you wanna risk?

10
00:00:31,106 --> 00:00:33,205
I am not looking for somebody

11
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:35,818
With some superhuman gifts

12
00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:38,005
Some superhero

13
00:00:38,099 --> 00:00:40,398
Some fairytale bliss

14
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:42,805
Just something I can turn to

15
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,798
Somebody I can kiss

16
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:47,513
I want something just like this

17
00:00:47,607 --> 00:00:54,406
Doo doo doo‚ doo doo doo

18
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:56,703
Oh‚ I want something just like this

19
00:00:56,801 --> 00:01:03,600
Doo doo doo‚ doo doo doo

20
00:01:03,712 --> 00:01:07,211
Oh‚ I want something just like this

21
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:15,556
I want something just like this

22
00:01:15,602 --> 00:01:22,701
Doo doo doo‚ doo doo doo

23
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:24,610
I have been reading books of old

24
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:26,901
The legends and the myths

25
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:29,300
The testaments they told

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,599
The moon and it is eclipse

27
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:34,014
And Superman unrolls

28
00:01:34,112 --> 00:01:37,111
A suit before he lifts

29
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:40,612
But I am not the kind of
person that it fit is

30
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,407
She said‚ where′d you wanna go?

31
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:45,516
How much you wanna risk?

32
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:47,717
I am not looking for somebody

33
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:50,002
With some superhuman gifts

34
00:01:50,116 --> 00:01:52,515
Some superhero

35
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:54,814
Some fairytale bliss

36
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,213
Just something I can turn to

37
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,318
Somebody I can miss

38
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:01,907
I want something just like this

39
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:08,716
Doo doo doo‚ doo doo doo

40
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:11,403
Oh‚ I want something just like this

41
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:18,018
Doo doo doo‚ doo doo doo

42
00:02:18,108 --> 00:02:22,307
Oh‚ I want something just like this

43
00:02:27,517 --> 00:02:29,916
Oh‚ I want something just like this

44
00:02:30,012 --> 00:02:36,811
Doo doo doo‚ doo doo doo

45
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:40,316
Oh‚ I want something just like this
