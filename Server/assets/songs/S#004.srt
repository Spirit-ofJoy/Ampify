1
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:23,418
Thought I found a way

2
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:28,611
Thought I found a way out (out)

3
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:33,204
But you never go away (never go away)

4
00:00:33,312 --> 00:00:36,461
So I guess I gotta stay now

5
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh I hope someday I will
make it out of here

6
00:00:45,108 --> 00:00:53,157
Even if it takes all night
or a hundred years

7
00:00:53,207 --> 00:01:01,606
Need a place to hide but
I can′t find one near

8
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:11,011
Wanna feel alive outside
I can′t fight my fear

9
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:13,700
Isn′t it lovely?

10
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,399
All alone

11
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:19,610
Heart made of glass my mind of stone

12
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,309
Tear me to pieces

13
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:24,108
Skin to bone

14
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,909
Hello

15
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,818
Welcome home

16
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:34,313
Walking out of time

17
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,408
Looking for a better place

18
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:42,751
Something′s on my mind

19
00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:44,814
(Mind)

20
00:01:44,912 --> 00:01:47,311
Always in my head space

21
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:55,860
But I know someday I will
make it out of here

22
00:01:55,902 --> 00:02:04,101
Even if it takes all night
or a hundred years

23
00:02:04,213 --> 00:02:12,512
Need a place to hide but
I can′t find one near

24
00:02:12,604 --> 00:02:22,453
Wanna feel alive outside
I can′t fight my fear

25
00:02:22,507 --> 00:02:24,906
Isn′t it lovely?

26
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:26,315
All alone

27
00:02:26,405 --> 00:02:30,604
Heart made of glass my mind of stone

28
00:02:30,706 --> 00:02:33,405
Tear me to pieces

29
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:35,304
Skin to bone

30
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:36,807
