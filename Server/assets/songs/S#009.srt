1
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:35,406
Look

2
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:38,201
If you had

3
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:40,310
One shot

4
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,009
Or one opportunity

5
00:00:43,807 --> 00:00:45,906
To seize everything you ever wanted

6
00:00:46,608 --> 00:00:47,807
In one moment

7
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:50,512
Would you capture it

8
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:52,255
Or just let it slip?

9
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:53,000
Yo

10
00:00:53,714 --> 00:00:56,413
His palms are sweaty‚ knees
weak‚ arms are heavy

11
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:59,200
There′s vomit on his sweater
already‚ mom′s spaghetti

12
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:02,011
He is nervous‚ but on the surface
he looks calm and ready

13
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:04,708
To drop bombs‚ but he
keeps on forgettin′

14
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:07,715
What he wrote down‚ the whole
crowd goes so loud

15
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:10,412
He opens his mouth‚ but the
words won′t come out

16
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:13,213
He is chokin′‚ how‚ everybody′s
jokin′ now

17
00:01:13,317 --> 00:01:16,116
The clocks run out‚ times
up‚ over‚ blaow!

18
00:01:16,212 --> 00:01:19,111
Snap back to reality‚ oh
there goes gravity

19
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:21,110
Oh‚ there goes Rabbit‚ he choked

20
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,613
He is so mad‚ but he won′t
give up that easy? No

21
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:26,504
He won′t have it‚ he knows his
whole back city′s ropes

22
00:01:26,616 --> 00:01:29,315
It don′t matter‚ He is dope‚ he
knows that‚ but He is broke

23
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:33,300
He is so stacked that he knows‚
when he goes back to his mobile
home‚ that′s when it is

24
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,909
Back to the lab again yo‚
this whole rhapsody

25
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:38,816
He better go capture this moment
and hope it don′t pass him

26
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:41,111
You better lose yourself in
the music‚ the moment

27
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:43,812
You own it‚ you better never let it go

28
00:01:43,912 --> 00:01:46,711
You only get one shot‚ do not
miss your chance to blow

29
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:50,216
This opportunity comes once
in a lifetime you better

30
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,517
You better lose yourself in
the music‚ the moment

31
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:55,208
You own it‚ you better never let it go

32
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:58,003
You only get one shot‚ do not
miss your chance to blow

33
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:01,110
This opportunity comes once
in a lifetime you better

34
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:04,117
The souls escaping‚ through this
hole that it is gaping

35
00:02:04,217 --> 00:02:06,116
This world is mine for the taking

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,499
Make me king‚ as we move toward
a‚ new world order

37
00:02:09,615 --> 00:02:13,614
A normal life is borin′‚ but super
stardom′s close to post mortem

38
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:16,405
It only grows harder‚
only grows hotter

39
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:19,212
He blows us all over these
hoes is all on him

40
00:02:19,302 --> 00:02:22,101
Coast to coast shows‚ He is
known as the globetrotter

41
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:26,300
Lonely roads‚ God only knows‚
He is grown farther from
home‚ He is no father

42
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:29,105
He goes home and barely knows
his own daughter

43
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:31,808
But hold your nose ′cause here
goes the cold water

44
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,699
His hoes don′t want him no
mo‚ He is cold product

45
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:38,900
They moved on to the next schmo who
flows‚ he nose dove and sold nada

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,199
So the soap opera is told and unfolds‚
I suppose It is old partna‚
but the beat goes on

47
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:45,504
Da da dumb da dumb da da

48
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,299
You better lose yourself in
the music‚ the moment

49
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:51,016
You own it‚ you better never let it go

50
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:54,005
You only get one shot‚ do not
miss your chance to blow

51
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:57,304
This opportunity comes once
in a lifetime you better

52
00:02:57,418 --> 00:02:59,517
You better lose yourself in
the music‚ the moment

53
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:02,318
You own it‚ you better never let it go

54
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,215
You only get one shot‚ do not
miss your chance to blow

55
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:08,404
This opportunity comes once
in a lifetime you better

56
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,709
No more games‚ I am a change
what you call rage

57
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:13,798
Tear this motherfuckin roof
off like two dogs caged

58
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,399
I was playin′ in the beginnin′‚
the mood all changed

59
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:19,512
I been chewed up and spit
out and booed off stage

60
00:03:19,614 --> 00:03:22,413
But I kept rhymin′ and stepwritin′
the next cipher

61
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:25,114
Best believe somebody′s
payin′ the pied piper

62
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,899
All the pain inside amplified by the

63
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,608
Fact that I can′t get
by with my nine to

64
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:33,401
Five and I can′t provide
the right type of

65
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:37,704
Life for my family ′cause man‚
these God damn food stamps
don′t buy diapers

66
00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:40,415
And it is no movie‚ there′s
no Mekhi Phifer

67
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:43,198
This is my life and these
times are so hard

68
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,409
And It is getting even harder tryin′
to feed and water my seed‚ plus

69
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:50,018
See dishonor caught up between bein′
a father and a prima dona

70
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:52,411
Baby mama drama screamin′
on and too much

71
00:03:52,517 --> 00:03:55,516
For me to want to say in one
spot‚ another jam or not

72
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:58,311
Has gotten me to the point‚ I
am like a snail I have got

73
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:01,118
To formulate a plot fore I
end up in jail or shot

74
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,707
Success is my only motherfuckin
option‚ failures not

75
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:09,512
Mom‚ I love you‚ but this trail
has got to go‚ I cannot grow
old in Salthems lot

76
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:10,917
So here I go is my shot

77
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:14,904
Feet fail me not ′cause maybe the
only opportunity that I got

78
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:17,801
You better lose yourself in
the music‚ the moment

79
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:20,606
You own it‚ you better never let it go

80
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:23,615
You only get one shot‚ do not
miss your chance to blow

81
00:04:23,707 --> 00:04:26,106
This opportunity comes once
in a lifetime you better

82
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,009
You better lose yourself in
the music‚ the moment

83
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:31,714
You own it‚ you better never let it go

84
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,809
You only get one shot‚ do not
miss your chance to blow

85
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:38,710
This opportunity comes once
in a lifetime you better

86
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,509
You can do anything you
set your mind to‚ man

87
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:53,504
