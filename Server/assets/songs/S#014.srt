00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,898
This night is cold in the kingdom

2
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:13,001
I can feel you fade away

3
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,312
From the kitchen to the
bathroom sink and

4
00:00:16,404 --> 00:00:18,953
Your steps keep me awake

5
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:22,114
Don′t cut me down‚ throw me out‚
leave me here to waste

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,309
I once was a man with
dignity and grace

7
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:28,508
Now I am slipping through the
cracks of your cold embrace

8
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:31,617
So please‚ please

9
00:00:31,717 --> 00:00:34,216
Could you find a way to
let me down slowly?
