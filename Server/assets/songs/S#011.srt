00:00:03,302 --> 00:00:07,401
I can′t write one song
that′s not about you

2
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:11,206
Can′t drink without thinking about you

3
00:00:11,236 --> 00:00:14,603
Is it too late to tell you that

4
00:00:14,637 --> 00:00:18,636
Everything means nothing
if I can′t have you?

5
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:22,099
I am in toronto and I got this view

6
00:00:22,137 --> 00:00:26,470
But I might as well be in a hotel room

7
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:29,445
It doesn′t matter cause
I am so consumed

8
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:34,110
Spending all my nights reading
texts from you

9
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:37,535
Oh‚ I am good at keeping my distance

10
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:41,444
I know that You are the
feeling I am missing

11
00:00:41,478 --> 00:00:45,345
You know that I hate to admit it

12
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:49,450
But everything means nothing
if I can′t have you

13
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:53,549

I am so sorry that my timings off

22
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:28,470
But I can′t move on if We
are still gona talk

23
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:31,383
Is it wrong for me to not want half

24
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:33,352
I want all of you

25
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:36,101
All the strings attached

26
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:39,432
